					<p>Being a very passionate and self-driven person, I always try to find different projects and ideas to learn something new and gain an experience.</p>
					<p>This leads me to my profession in web. First 3 years I made a simple Landing pages, websites and emails. Years later I understood that email development excites me the most and I love fixing Outlook bugs, testing new style updates and make great responsive emails. And this became my specialisation.</p>

							<h2>About me</h2>
            
              <p>Being a very passionate and self-driven person, I always try to find different projects and ideas to learn something new and gain an experience.</p>
              <p>This leads me to my profession in web. First, I made a simple Landing pages, websites and emails for different companies.</p>
              <p>Several years later I found out that email development excites me the most and I love fixing Outlook bugs, testing new style updates and make great responsive emails.</p>

              <div class="description">
              <p>As one of my true passion is planning, including creating and automating processes and workflow, I was extremely happy about my promotion to Team Lead.</p>
              <p>That was time full of big discoveries and huge mistakes, but I was sure I can do it. And I did it! I grew a wonderfull team, who wasn't afraid to make mistakes and share their expertise and thoughts. Team who helped me learn how to delegate and trust. Team that became a family.</p>
              <p>As a result of 3.5 years of my team lead responsibilities I implemented several significant changes: </p>
              </div>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Biult work processes with designers, marketing and field management teams</li>
                <li>Coached HTML remote team in Bucharest office</li>
                <li>Implemented Jira, Confluence documentation, deadline guides, code review and monthly meetings to share experience</li>
                <li>Dramatically decreased amount of tasks for HTML team, by organising HTML and CSS courses for marketing to solve simple tasks by their own</li>
                <li>Implemented Marketo automatization and email scripting to ease Nurturing tracks management</li>
              </ul>

              <p>But it was time to move on and I decided to try myself in startup bank company</p>
              <p>Here I need to do much more out of my responsibilities and skill set, so I start training a new skill set for marketing automation, email campaigns and email marketing planning</p>
              <p>Now I'm the only person responsible for Email Marketing full circle: 
              <ul>
                <li>Content creation, discovering new ideas for future content</li>
                <li>Communication and nurturing planning</li>
                <li>Creating email templates</li>
                <li>Managing and running Marketo triggers and batches</li>
              </ul>

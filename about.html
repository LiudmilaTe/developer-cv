					<h2 class="inner">Hobbies</h2>

					<p>My life is not only about coding, it's also about travelling, sailing and enjoying every second with my friends and family.</p>
					<p>I love watching football games, especially Barcelona's which I've supported since 2003. The atmosphere at the stadium, team spirit and the rhythm of game make this sport the best in the world for me.</p>
					<p>A year ago I tried a new activity - sailing. It's a whole new world of enthusiasts who greet everyone who decides to join.</p>
					<p>Boats, wind, everyday's challenges and amaizing sunsets - that's all sailing.</p>

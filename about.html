					<h2>A few words about myself</h2>

					<p>My name is Liudmila Te. I was born in Russia and spent my early ages in Siberia. At the age of 5 my family moved to St-Petersburg where I live now.</p>
					<p>I was an active child and tried a lot of activities, that's why during my school years I sang in school chorus, run in athlete team and acted in "Club of the Funny and Inventive People"(KVN).</p>
					<p>In university I became interested in computer technologies and love to administrate my home Linux system. Later it evolved to web technologies and email development which I practicing nowadays.</p>
					<p>And after all this years, I'm still eager to read and learn about some new technologies, test new features of well known HTML & CSS, create some pages or emails just for fun.</p>
					
					<p>Even now, while creating this micro-site, I was excited to think about the structure, design (kind of), and I'm sure I will continue to update and change it. Just because I like the process and wanrt to see a good result.</p>

					<h2 class="inner">Hobbies</h2>

					<p>My life is not only about coding, it's also about travelling, sailing and enjoying every second with my friends and family.</p>
					<p>I love watching football games, especially Barcelona's which I've supported since 2003. The atmosphere at the stadium, team spirit and the rhythm of game make this sport the best in the world for me.</p>
					<p>A year ago I tried a new activity - sailing. It's a whole new world of enthusiasts who greet everyone who decides to join.</p>
					<p>Boats, wind, everyday's challenges and amaizing sunsets - that's all sailing.</p>
